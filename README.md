# PiPlayer

This is a tornado-based Python "webserver" that's really designed to be used as a back-end to a Raspberry Pi Music Player.  You can set up your Pi in "kiosk mode", and play music off it with this.  Its intended to be used with Adafruit's TFT screens.

I built this to use in my car :)

Its not done yet.  I'll update this README.md with real instructions when it is done.  For now, I am using github as an easy way to sync my dev machine and Pi.
